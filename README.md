# WordGuess
A simple game where you attempt to guess a word by guessing random letters a limited amount of times. Each round a new word is randomly chosen from a selection. Keypress events are recognized and populate the corresponding position in the guess fields when the correct key is pressed. 
There are however a limited amount of time, and a limited amount of guesses! Best of luck!
